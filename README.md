Project Description: 
The Customized Email Sender project is an automated tool that allows users to send personalized emails to a list of recipients. Users provide their ID, application password, and an Excel file containing email addresses. The application customizes each email by incorporating the recipient's name dynamically. Once the emails are sent, the Excel file is securely deleted from the server. This project simplifies bulk email communication while ensuring data privacy.
